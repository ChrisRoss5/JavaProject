            <title>8/27 Daily Recap, Outlook, and Trading Plan</title>
            <link>https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ES1!/MI6S46jb-8-27-Daily-Recap-Outlook-and-Trading-Plan/</link>
            <description>Recap Friday was a typical Jackson Hole day, characterized by unpredictability and traps. As predicted, the day saw extensive trapping where the price would make an initial move, trap traders, reverse, and then repeat. Despite the volatility, bulls won the day, maintaining control as long as the 4408 level held. Market Outlook: Neutral to Bullish Key Structures There are several key structures to watch. The large rising uptrend channel in white, which failed on Tuesday, August 15th, causing a 120 point flush, needs to reclaim to set a definitive bottom. The yellow channel, a failed bull flag with 4523 resistance and support around 4408-10, needs to be re-entered by the bulls. Lastly, the head and shoulders pattern built since mid-June tried to breakdown the "neckline" at 4375 Thursday and failed, indicating a bullish failed breakdown. Support Levels Supports are at 4408-10 (major), 4402, 4382-85 (major), 4375 (major), 4363, 4357 (major), 4348, 4339 (major), 4328, 4319-23 (major), 4311, 4298-4301 (major), 4282-86 (major), 4272, 4266, 4247 (major), 4235 (major). Resistance Levels Resistances are at 4423 (major), 4429,4437-40 (major), 4448, 4453 (major), 4467, 4474 (major), 4482, 4487-92 (major), 4499, 4512 (major), 4522 (major), 4527, 4540-45 (major), 4554, 4560, 4566-68, 4576-80 (major), 4592, 4598, 4607-09 (major). Trading Plan For Monday, the bull case remains the same. As long as the level of 4408 is maintained, the rally is alive. The bear case requires the level of 4375 to fail. In both cases, it is essential to see the level fully accepted before attempting shorts or longs. If 4408 fails, we play the levels. If 4375 fails, we free fall. Wrap Up In summary, we are still in deep chop around the 4408 magnet. My general lean as of now is that as long as 4408-10 keeps holding, we can base build then continue up the levels. If 4408 fails, we play the levels. If 4375 fails, we free fall. As always, trade with caution and don't chase. Disclosure: This is not financial advice and is for informational purposes only.

            <description>Hey everyone, Doing something a bit different. I am posting an independent analysis for NQ1! and ES1!. I usually cover these in my Monday market outlook video but not everyone who trades SPY tracks ES and NQ and not everyone who trades NQ and ES tracks SPY. So just breaking it up so that the content and information that individuals are interested in are more easily accessible and separate. Do remember, I always recommend tracking both Futures and the underlying ETF even if you only trade the ETF or futures version, because they can be insightful and show things that one may be missing. The video covers the intra-day levels for tonight and tomorrow as well as the overall weekly targets and thresholds. Let me know if you have any questions or comments and safe trades everyone! Thanks for watching :-)! Side Note: The probability Oscillator Indicator is linked below. The supply and demand analysis using Heikin Ashi video is also linked below.</description>

            <description>Current Gold short zone 1942-1945. look for confirmation to down side with the break and retest of current trendline. Falling RSI can be seen as another conformation of price decreasing. Look for pull back to the 1.27 fib level on 30 min time frame. Possible sideways range between 1925-1940 for consolidation as price are far away from higher time frame moving averages. Short 1942-1945 TP 1927 SL 1956</description>

            <description>Natural Gas has been very predictive and consistently trading in the range between 2.45 to 2.9(max $3). - as long as RSI stays above 40 (14day RSI) - NG will be on sidelines with some spikes (based on weekly NG data) - last 3 month contacts ending at 2.55 to 2.6 - Every month on calendar date 14 to 16th it is touching lows and goes up for next week and comes down by the time monthly contact expires - then recovers for 7 days then falls to lowest of the month. - 200 MA still holding up and moving up - 14 and 50 day MA converging and steadying - as long as smaller triangle formation inside the range (2.45 to 2.89) stays - it won't fall below 2.4 or it wont go beyond 3.2 (max). - Given factful data NG inventories raises cooling down every week and temp still stay above avg in US and getting close to winter season in Q4 will keep NG prices volatile but stay in sideline ranges. CONCLUSION : Stick to basics and fundamental principle of technical trading - it is best time in many years to trade NG !</description>

            <description>The weekly chart shows the wick rejecting the harmonic closing below 15300. Nonetheless the bulls are still closing above 14900. I wouldn't be surprised if gaps blow out the open. If youre super conservative then wait for a break of B ~13800 to target the bullish gartley ~8500 #astrogumbo</description>

            <description>SPY ES GamePlan ! Sunday- Monday Aug 28 ES Long Above 4429 Short Below 4389 but looking to take the 78 short ! under 4415! Tight risk at 4416! ð£ MpowerTrades Daily Trading Outlook - Aug 28 ð£ Hello Traders, As we gear up for the trading day on Monday, August 28th, we're here to provide you with insights and expectations for SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) trading. Opening Expectation: SPY is projected to open at $438.75. Intraday Price Range: Based on a 14-day Average True Range, anticipate a movement range between $434.98 and $444.92 throughout the day. This suggests a potential trading interval of approximately +/-$4.97 (+/-1.13%) from the last closing price. If SPY reaches the full calculated swing range, there might be an estimated 2.26% movement between the lowest and highest prices of the day. Support and Resistance: With the stock closer to the support from accumulated volume at $439.66 (0.07%), compared to the resistance at $442.55 (0.59%), our systems indicate an attractive risk/reward ratio for intraday trading. This suggests potential profit opportunities before reaching the first resistance level. SPY's Outlook: Presently, SPY displays several negative signals, leading us to believe in its weak performance over the coming days or weeks. Our evaluation of this ETF remains negative. Remember, successful trading involves staying informed and being adaptable to market dynamics. Make sure to utilize these insights in conjunction with your own analysis for well-informed trading decisions. Wishing you a profitable trading day ahead! MpowerTrades!</description>

            <description>Price appears to have rejected from the Bulls intermediate wave (5) up, last week. It could be a wave 2, BUT look at the structure of the upward retrace! It is a 3 wave move! Not even a "leading Diagonal" (or whatever..). This action reconciles to the downside. The next move is unclear as far as, what will it be, but the magnitude seems all but certain...it will be a Minute ((i)) or a Minute ((v)). If a Minute ((v)), we should retrace in Minor 2 over the following 2 weeks...if Minute ((i)), we should get a Minute ((ii)) retrace over the following 4-5 days...then, GOOD NIGHT, CHARLIE. Either way, I will be closing or looking to straddle above 4238, to see, what is next?</description>

            <link>https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ES1!/nSpUbUzR-ES-F-Day-Trading-Prep-Week-8-27-9-01/</link>
            <description>Levels To Watch : Key Resistance 4445-37 // Current 4422.75-18.75 // 16.50 ? Target if over 4465-60.25 // 87.25-79.75 Current Support 4478.50-74.75 // Key For Continuation Lower 4362.75-55 Targets if under 4349.50-45 // 38.50-31.50 // 27.25-21.50 *** 4405.25-4392.25 ? This was previous Key Resistance and 4416-05 is our VAL on 4hr, we closed within it but we don't know if it will act as Support or not, If market cant hold over it then that would be our sign of weakness. Last Week : Going into last week 4378-74 was our pinata low for the week to crack in order to see lower prices, as discussed in last Sundays prep IF we do hold over it then that could bring tests of Current Resistance // Key Resistance and if we hold over then that could bring the test of higher stops. We were able to clear all the upper stops and back fill towards our HTF Mean area around 4487-60 but the run up was done after hours/Globex and market just couldn't hold, closer we got to RTH the more selling came in. End of week we ran out of buying and inventory flushed back under Key Resistance, broke our Pinata Low with volume but buying came in at Current Support for the week which pushed us back over 78-74 and into Resistance. One of the things I noticed is how long it took us to clean up under 4405 to get back inside value, if we trapped size and had strong buyers here would it take us that long to push back inside value? This Week : This week we are set to open around our VAL 4416.50-05.25, under Supply that was again trapped over 4420 and close to our bigger Supports.... sounds fun! So where can we head from here? We had some strong selling Thursday/Friday out of our VAH and Value area but our range Support held the tests and gave us a close back in Key Area. Seems like buying here from last week is just short covering and new longs who aren't strong enough to hold us up over Key Areas just yet with stronger buying coming below 4370s. For the Downside - IF the Market can't hold over 4416.50 that would signal continued weakness and if 4405.25-92.25 area doesn't act as Support then we could see more selling. If we break and start holding below that it could bring in test of Current Support at 4378.50-74.75 IF we break it again that would give us another chance at lower targets. 4362.75-55 Would be the Key area to hold under during the week, under we could see more weakness towards 4349.50-45 // 38.50-31.50 // 4327.25-21.50 These areas are close to our HTF Key Support so watch out for buyers at first tests and even possible a stronger bounce? If the market shows. We do have Contract Roll Gap under and we would have to see if we have enough supply to get inside it to maybe make a move towards bigger Support or no? For the Upside - IF 4405.25-4392.25 can act as Support and Market can hold over it then that could bring in more buyers to get us back over VAL at 4416.50. We would need to get over that and hold over 22.78-18.75 which is a pretty big Current Resistance as we didn't have much buying over it last week. Only holding over that can bring higher prices and give a chance at 4445-37.75 which would be our mean and next Key Area to get through/hold over. Unless we can do that then I would be careful trying to long unless its from Support areas if they show holds or strong buying from targets if they happen. Possible stronger buying area could be 4431.50-21.50 and under IF we get there. ** We could as well spend time in range under Value between 4420s-4370s-50s without going too much lower as this is still area of buying and unless we hold under/over Key areas then need to be careful. We do have lots of Market moving data this week so hopefully we can get some good trading and wont stay in range.</description>

            <description>We look to have one more high in this three wave corrective move, with charts pointing to a challenge of 4500 to end (X). AS a of (X) was a leading diagonal structure, c should continue on with the form of an impulse, with b of (X) marked by Friday's post-Powell low. From there, (w) = (Y) symmetry in shape and time gives a challenge of the 4211 level in mid September. Looking for a continued orderly march lower as volatility remains suppressed and drops find buyers at key pivots and levels. BULLISH to 4500, then BEARISH in three waves to 4211 decision point.</description>

            <title>A controversial topic!</title>
            <link>https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ES1!/OF4z3two-A-controversial-topic/</link>
            <description>Hello everyone, let's go there, because today I brought a controversial topic to the debate. I hope it is of some value to the community! Do you really know how to "create and use" an uptrend line? -If so, very good, because I firmly believe that you are on the path to success. However, if your answer is no, this analysis will certainly give you an "initiation" for future studies. To better orient ourselves, we must keep in mind that assets move along three distinct timelines, and they are: Long term, medium term and short term. -Assets and economies need these "stages" to mold themselves to situations that happened in the past. -Faced with the events experienced, the "best decisions" are made with a view to the future (but they are not always the best decisions). -After decisions are taken, the fruits are usually harvested some time later, which can vary from 50 days (through money printers and zero-cost loans) to more than 1 year (creating laws, tax incentives, etc.) depending on the situation experienced in the past. (crisis size). I will cite as an example the current president of Brazil Luiz InÃ¡cio LULA da silva about a crisis experienced by Brazil and the world in 2008, and his speech was more or less the following: "the crisis is a tsunami in the USA but, if it reaches the Brazil, will be 'marolinha'. -With that phrase said, we can easily deduce that the decisions taken by Brazil and the USA were completely different, because the Brazilian "little wave" in the end turned into a giant wave, and in 2015/2016 these fruits came very bitter. But we cannot forget that the US is also in crisis (interest rates) due to decisions related to infinite money printers. Yes, printing money generates inflation. (lol) Now let's talk about the uptrend line (UL) and better unraveling these lines, we will have the following: a) Long-term. Monthly weather chart. (lol) b) Medium term. Weekly chart time. c) Short term. Daily time chart. We should always use as background the important points (events) that occurred in the analyzed chart period, and with that we connect two "important points from the past" to know where prices can go in the present. See in the image below how many bullish trend lines (UL) the monthly chart (SPX - ES!) showed us when we started from an extremely important fund, the SUBPRIME, which occurred at the end of 2008 and we linked this fund to other funds that were equally important at the time! https://www.tradingview.com/x/cNKBKHBR/ By drawing these important parallels (bottoms) we create an UL (uptrend), and it will serve as a "compass" for future decision-making. Now I ask you a question and I hope you are sincere: What do you find more reliable, a price average or an uptrend line? And another question. What will the next crisis be? Perhaps the answer may lie in this graphic analysis. This graphic analysis is really worth reading. https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/0Ke2m2jj-It-s-strange-But-those-are-the-prospects/ Do your analysis and good business. Be Aware, If You Buy, Use Stop Loss! See below for other graphic reviews!</description>

            <description>After a correction in the daily chart, the market came back down to retest a weekly accumulation level (forming a new mode, from where a possible bullish trend signal can trigger). Daily has been basing for long enough to trigger a reversal signal if price breaks over the yellow level shown in the chart. If that were to happen you can enter longs safely aiming to capture a move towards 15667. Additionally, if this happened, the weekly chart would be in a position to confirm a weekly continuation setup, which could propel index futures much higher as per the cyan box, for roughly 8 weeks in a row. Best of luck! Cheers, Ivan Labrie.</description>
