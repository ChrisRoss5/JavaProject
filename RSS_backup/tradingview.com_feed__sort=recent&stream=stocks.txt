But now some traders may look for its uptrend to continue.

The first pattern on today’s chart is the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). The recent dip was META’s first pullback to this line all year.  

Next is the series of higher lows since August 25. Prices have simultaneously pushed against the $299 area where they got rejected on August 24. That combination of higher lows and upside resistance could be viewed as an ascending triangle -- a potentially bullish continuation pattern.

Third, Bollinger Bandwidth has contracted to its tightest range since late May. Does that open the door to potential price expansion?

Finally, MACD recently turned upward.

But with interest rates staying high, bears could be moving into the neighborhood.

Today’s chart focuses on Home Depot. Similar patterns appear on related charts including  NYSE:LEN  Lennar,  NYSE:PHM  PulteGroup and  NYSE:TOL  Toll Brothers.

The first issue is potential bearish divergence. HD made a six-month high on August 15. But notice how MACD, Wilder’s RSI and Rate of Change peaked earlier and were falling at the time. Those lower studies may indicate slowing momentum.

Second is the emergence of a potential falling channel. In late August, HD dipped below its price range from earlier in the month. It then peaked around $333 on September 1, which was about $5 below the August 15 zenith. In other words, a lower low was followed by a lower high. 

Finally, the macro environment may be more difficult for housing. Optimism about supply and demand boosted sentiment earlier in the year. But now strong economic data could be keeping rates higher for longer. That may cause some anxiety and reality checks in the coming weeks.

<p>Homebuilders were a surprise leader in the first half. But with interest rates staying high, bears could be moving into the neighborhood. <br/>

Today’s chart focuses on Home Depot. Similar patterns appear on related charts including

 <br/>
The first issue is potential bearish divergence. HD made a six-month high on August 15. But notice how MACD, Wilder’s RSI and Rate of Change peaked earlier and were falling at the time. Those lower studies may indicate slowing momentum. <br/>
 <br/>
Second is the emergence of a potential falling channel. In late August, HD dipped below its price range from earlier in the month. It then peaked around $333 on September 1, which was about $5 below the August 15 zenith. In other words, a lower low was followed by a lower high.  <br/>
 <br/>
Finally, the macro environment may be more difficult for housing. Optimism about supply and demand boosted sentiment earlier in the year. But now strong economic data could be keeping rates higher for longer. That may cause some anxiety and reality checks in the coming weeks. <br/>

 The reason is in the news that came from China: 

→ According to the WSJ, Chinese central government officials have been ordered not to use iPhones or bring them to the office. Apple's business is very vulnerable to tensions between China and the US, as most of the US company's products are made in China.
→ Chinese Huawei has developed a new high-speed phone that can become a serious competitor to the iPhone. The first batch of the phone, the Mate 60 Pro, priced at USD 960 on a limited pre-order basis, sold out in a matter of hours, causing a sensation on Chinese social media.

 With the SHS pattern in the background, AAPL shares are technically weak: 

→ the price has tested the bearish gap formed at the beginning of August;
→ USD 188/share AAPL, which acted as support in July, now appears to be resisting;
→ after the August reversal from the lower border of the channel (shown in blue), the bulls failed to return to the upper half of the channel.

 https://www.tradingview.com/x/Miiwwi67/ 

Bulls can oppose a serious argument — the price is in an upward channel. And AAPL is one of the leaders in the NASDAQ Technology Index, which is rising on the AI-related boom.

However, AAPL's share price continued to decline in premarket trading, dropping below the USD 180 level, and thus threatening a bearish breakdown of the rising channel in 2023. The nearest support is the level of 176.50, where earlier the price slowed down the fall or turned up.

However, AAPL's share price continued to decline in premarket trading, dropping below the USD 180 level, and thus threatening a bearish breakdown of the rising channel in 2023. The nearest support is the level of 176.50, where earlier the price slowed down the fall or turned up. <br/>

 Price Chart 

Apple's price action has filled it's August gap (White Dotted) and turned lower pushing past the 12, 26, and 50-day EMA's in one swoop.  Both RSI and OBV have created trend lines (Yellow Solid) that the indicators look to be respecting with failed retest; as RSI is on the verge of pushing below the 50 level.

 What Seems Legit? 

This bad boy finally cooling off.  It's up 60% YTD.  First retest it's 200-day EMA then retest it's major trend line and some good chaos in-between.

Nvidia, the chip manufacturer, has unquestionably been the standout stock of the year, driven by the increasing demand for its 'supercomputer' chips that are playing a key role in the AI revolution. 

The company's shares have experienced a remarkable uptrend, surging by an impressive 227% year-to-date. However, we are starting to see some subtle signs that Nvidia’s share price might be nearing a turning point.

Before we break down why Nvidia’s powerful uptrend might be coming to an end, let’s take a look at the year-to-date view on the daily candle chart:

 NVDA Daily Candle Chart YTD 
 https://www.tradingview.com/x/6qTaxCit/ 

We can see that Nvidia’s shares have been running relentlessly higher since the turn of the year with prices comfortably above the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages. 

Whilst calling the end of established trends like this tends to be foolish, we are seeing some signs that Nvidia’s share price may be due for a deeper retracement. 

Let’s zoom in and take a closer look at Nvidia’s recent price action:

 NVDA Daily Candle Chart Zoomed View 
 https://www.tradingview.com/x/AdvokIhk/ 

On this zoomed view we can see that during the last two weeks, Nvidia’s share price has struggled to break and hold above resistance at $480.85.

We’ve seen multiple dark cloud cover patterns print at resistance – this pattern is created when the market gaps higher at the open only to end the session back within the previous days range. 

And this week, we have seen the shares attempt to hold above resistance only for the market to close lower during yesterday’s session.

It is also worth noting that whilst prices have continued to carve out a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been trending lower.

This negative divergence on the RSI, combined with the recurring failures at resistance indicate that selling pressure is starting to build and we could start to see some profit taking.
 
 Risk management 

Counter-trend trades pose the risk of the established trend continuing, so traders should always use prudent risk management. 

For stop placement, traders could use the recent highs or a multiple of Nvidia’s average true range (ATR). 

On the calendar, we have Nvidia’s appearance at the Citi Global Technology Conference today (7th September) and Nvidia’s appearance at the Bank of America Global AI Conference on 11th September. These events have the potential to increase the volatility of Nvidia’s share price. 

It is also worth noting that Nvidia’s share price will be sensitive to global macro-economic data and events.

Breakout trading implementation:

1. **Identifying New Trends:** Breakout trading helps traders identify the beginning of new trends by focusing on price levels where an asset breaks out of its historical trading range.

2. **Volatility Indicator:** Breakouts often occur when there's increased volatility in the market. Monitoring breakouts can provide insights into shifts in market sentiment and potential price movements.

3. **Entry Points:** Breakout points serve as potential entry points for traders looking to ride the momentum of a newly established trend. Buying on a breakout can capture the early stages of a price movement.

4. **Confirmation of Strength:** Successful breakouts indicate the strength of a trend. If an asset breaks out with high volume and follows through with sustained price movement, it suggests a strong trend in that direction.

5. **Avoiding False Signals:** Breakout strategies often include using indicators or confirmation signals to avoid false breakouts. This can enhance the accuracy of trade decisions.

6. **Defined Risk and Reward:** Breakout trading allows for setting clear stop-loss levels below the breakout point, which helps manage risk. Traders can also calculate potential profits based on the distance between the breakout point and a projected target.

7. **Adaptable to Various Markets:** Breakout trading can be applied to various markets, including stocks, forex, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. The concept remains consistent across different assets.

8. **Flexibility:** Traders can adapt breakout strategies to their preferred timeframes, whether they are day traders, swing traders, or long-term investors.

9. **Liquidity Opportunities:** Breakout points are often associated with increased trading volume, which can provide better liquidity for executing trades.

10. **Risk vs. Reward Assessment:** Traders can evaluate the potential risk of a trade (stop-loss) against the potential reward (target price), aiding in decision-making and portfolio management.

11. **Psychological Advantage:** Successful breakout trades can boost a trader's confidence and discipline, reinforcing the effectiveness of their strategy.

12. **Market Events:** Breakouts can occur around significant market events such as earnings reports, economic data releases, or geopolitical developments, offering traders opportunities to capitalize on sudden price movements.

Remember, while breakout trading offers potential advantages, it also carries risks. False breakouts and market reversals can lead to losses. Successful implementation requires a solid understanding of technical analysis, risk management, and the ability to adapt to changing market conditions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 04:28:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DCMSRIND/MFjeBWuS-Another-volatility-contractions-blast/</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[
